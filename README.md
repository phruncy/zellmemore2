# Zellmemore

## About

[Zellmemore.de](http://zellmemore.de/#/home) is a web application that offers the possibility to explore the principle of elementary cellular automata with different interactive graphic interpretations. 
These mathematical models of self-organized systems that repeatedly apply a simple algorithm on themselves. Despite - or probably due to? â€“ being so simple, their behavior is of astonishing complexity. 
Even more intriguingly, these systems with roots in theoretical computer science can model real world behaviors surprisingly accurate. Some of them have even been proven to be Turing complete! 
From the answer to the question why we get stuck in traffic for no reason to the ultimate question of Life, the Universe, and Everything: they give answers to scientific questions, but also raise questions about the connection between nature and numbers.
